# Project 3: Spots

### Overview

- Spots is a social media page where users can create a small profile and upload images with short descriptions, also view others profiles and like others images.

It is made with a grid layout that adapts to various screen sizes. Along with grid layout, it uses media queries to change the layout and sizes of text and images for use with smaller screens.

Plans for Improvement:
The obvious plan is to make the site usable for the user. As the buttons for editing and adding photos are non-funtioning at this stage.
