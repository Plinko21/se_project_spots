# Project 3: Spots

### Overview

- Spots is a social media page where users can create a small profile and upload images with short descriptions, also view others profiles and like others images.

It is made with a grid layout that adapts to various screen sizes. Along with grid layout, it uses media queries to change the layout and sizes of text and images for use with smaller screens.

- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
